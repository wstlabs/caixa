# caixa
`caixa` [ˈka(j).ʃɐ] - magic box o' Python tools

A monopackage for generic functions, classes and decorators I use occasionally (in some cases very frequently) in development projects.  My personal standard library, as it were.  The name `caixa` means "box" in Portuguese, and has the same Latin root (*capio*) as English words like "capture", "cash", "chase", "cassette", etc.
